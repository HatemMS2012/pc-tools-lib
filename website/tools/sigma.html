<p>Sig.ma is a web application that does not require anything special to be installed, apart from a modern Web browser. To use it, first go to its website and then enter either a list of keywords or the address of a resource in the search box. Sig.ma will query Sindice to find data about the queried words / resources and aggregate all the results into a data list. The controls on the right of the page allow for validating the data sources and wrongly ones can be filtered out. The final, filtered, set of data about the resource can then be saved for later use.</p>
