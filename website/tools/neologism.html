<p>Neologism is a web application that is based on the content manager <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a>. As such, it requires to have a working web server with some <a href="http://neologism.deri.ie/requirements">minimum requirements</a>:
<ul>
	<li>A Web server that can run PHP 5.2 or higher scripts and supports Drupal Clean URLs (the usage of mod_rewrite for Apache is recommended)</li>
	<li>A MySQL server version 5.0.15 or higher</li>
	<li>The PDO database extension for PHP</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>All-in-one packages such as <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/">WAMP</a>  and <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html">MAMP</a> can be used to install all of the above on either a Windows or MacOS system.</p>
<p>Installation procedure:
<ol>
	<li>Uncompress the <a href="http://neologism.googlecode.com/files/neologism-0.4.10.zip">downloaded release of Neologism</a> into a directory accessible from the Web server. For instance, if the Web server is configured to access content in the "srv" directory, unpack the content of the archive for Neologism into "srv/neologism".</li>
	<li>Create an empty database and name it with a properly name. For instance, "neologism-db".</li></li>
	<li>Open the address http://localhost/neologism in a web browser to start the installation procedure. In that address, replace "neologism" by the name of the directory you unpacked neologism into. The installer is a friendly procedure asking several questions about the configuration to generate. Screenshots of the differents steps are available on the Drupal web site.</li>
