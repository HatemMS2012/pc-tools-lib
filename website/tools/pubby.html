<p>Pubby  makes it easy to turn a SPARQL endpoint into a Linked Data server by offering a Linked Data and HTML interface. Pubby provides dereferenceable URIs by rewriting URIs found in the SPARQL-exposed dataset into the Pubby server's namespace. Furthermore it takes care of handling 303 redirects and content negotiation.</p>
<p>In order to set up Pubby, you need to:
<ol>
	<li>Download the <a href="http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/pubby/download">latest version</a> of Pubby.</li>
	<li>If you haven't already, download and install a servlet container. Pubby has been tested with Tomcat and Jetty.</li>
	<li>Unzip the Pubby distribution and copy the webapp directory into the servlet container's webapps folder. If Pubby is the only web application you want to run in the container, then rename the webapp directory to root. Otherwise, rename it to something like mydataset. Assuming your server is set up to run at http://myserver/, this will change the Pubby root to http://myserver/mydataset/.</li>
	<li>Modify the <a href="http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/pubby/#configuration">configuration file</a> to suit your needs. It is located within Pubby's webapp directory, at /WEB-INF/config.ttl.</li>
</ol>
