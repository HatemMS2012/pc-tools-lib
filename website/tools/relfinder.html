<p>RelFinder display the relations between resources on the Web of Data, it is available <a href="http://relfinder.dbpedia.org/relfinder.html">online</a> and there is nothing to install for using. The main interface of the application has input boxes on the left part used to give a set of resources to look for relations among them. Just enter two or more keywords and press the button "find relations" to see which other concepts connect them. The data comes from a pre-defined set of SPARQL endpoints, if an endpoint is missing it can be added by clicking on the wrench icon.</p>
