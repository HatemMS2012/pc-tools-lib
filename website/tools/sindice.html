<p>Sindice is a web application so there is nothing to install. The only requirement is to have a modern Web browser to access to the main site of Sindice . They are essentially two ways to use Sindice: either as a search engine to find data on the Web of Data or as an inspector tool to see how some data published is seen on the Web of Data. The first usage is similar to that of Google, the second usage is an alternative to using tools like Any23.</p>
<p>Search engine:
<ul>
	<li>Click on the "search" tab on the main page of Sindice and enter some keyword corresponding to the searched information in the dedicated entry box, then press enter. The result is a list of resources matching the search criteria, and the possibility to filter them.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Data inspector:
<ul>
	<li>Click on the "inspector tool" tab on the main page of Sindice and enter the address of a page on the Web. The document can be a resource from the Web of Data (such as http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amsterdam) or a Web document (such as http://librdf.org). The result is the list of triples found at that address.</li>
</ul>
