<p>The R2R Framework enables Linked Data applications which discover data on the Web, that is represented using unknown terms, to search the Web for mappings and apply the discovered mappings to translate Web data to the application's target vocabulary.</p>
<p>The R2R Framework currently consists of:
<ul>
	<li>the <a href="http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/bizer/r2r/spec/#specification">R2R Mapping Language</a>, a declarative mapping language for representing correspondences between terms from different RDF vocabularies.</li>
	<li>the <a href="http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/bizer/r2r/spec/#usingR2RAPI">R2R Java API</a>, a modular API which makes use of the mappings to transform Web data to a target vocabulary.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>To use the R2R Framework, you need:
<ul>
	<li>Java 1.5 or higher to run R2R</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>What to do:
<ol>
	<li>Download and extract the latest R2R version  into a suitable location.</li>
	<li>Test your installation with an example from the Examples section.</li>
	<li>Write your own mappings using the R2R Mapping Language.</li>
</ol>
